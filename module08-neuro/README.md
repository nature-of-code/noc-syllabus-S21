# Genetic Algorithms

## Core Material

For each module, I will provide written and video tutorials on the topics. You can review whichever format suits you best. If the amount feels overwhelming, please reach out and we can help you narrow things down, and select a subset of the material to focus an exercise around. It's a lot!

- ðŸ“• [A Peopleâ€™s Guide to AI](https://www.alliedmedia.org/files/peoples-guide-ai.pdf) by Mimi Onuoha and Mother Cyborg (chapters 4-5, p. 43-67)
- ðŸ“— [Nature of Code 10.1 - 10.4](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-10-neural-networks/) (skip 10.5 on, JS version of chapter not yet ready)
- ðŸŽ¥ [What is a Neural Network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) from 3Blue1Brown (19 minutes)
- ðŸš‚ [Train a Neural Network with ml5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/learning/ml5/6.1-train-your-own.html) (35 minutes)

## Code Examples

- TBD

## Supplemental Material

For each module, I will provide a list of additional video tutorials and readings that you may draw on for further exploration. It's unlikely you would be able to consume everything in one week and if you are looking for guidance about what might fit with your interests and learning style the most, please reach out.
