## Simulation Project

Now is the time to take the concepts from the first 6 weeks and apply them to a project idea. This "mid-semester exercise" can be anything that builds off of or is inspired by the material from the motion and physics material. It does not need to be a "fully realized thing" -- it can be a visual experiment in progress or a piece of a larger project you are building for another context (thesis, another class, etc.). You should also feel free to think non-traditionally, i.e. your project need not be a Processing or p5.js sketch.

Here are some ideas for projects / technical exercises if you are feeling stuck:

- Extend one or more of the examples into 3D.
- Design a simulation of a single creature (that you imagine living in a larger eco-system).
- Develop a non keyboard/mouse way of interacting with an environment's forces (i.e. video tracking, sensors, etc.)
- Use physics simulation to fabricate something -- a print, a sculpture, etc.
- Create a flow field using image/pixel data.
- Create a flocking simulation where all of the parameters (separation weight, cohesion weight, alignment weight, maximum force, maximum speed) change over time. Two ideas are using Perlin noise or user interaction.
- Build a creature with countless steering behaviors. Think about ways to vary the weights for these behaviors so that you can dial them up and down, mixing and matching on the fly. How are the creature's initial weights set? What rules drive how the weights change over time?
- Complex systems can be nested. Can you design a single creature out of a flock of boids? And can you then make a flock of those creatures?
