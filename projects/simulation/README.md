## Simulation Project

Now is the time to take the concepts from the first 6 weeks and apply them to a project idea. This "mid-semester exercise" can be anything that builds off of or is inspired by the material from the motion and physics material. It does not need to be a "fully realized thing" -- it can be a visual experiment in progress or a piece of a larger project you are building for another context (thesis, another class, etc.). You should also feel free to think non-traditionally, i.e. your project need not be a Processing or p5.js sketch.

Here are some ideas for projects / technical exercises if you are feeling stuck:

- Extend one or more of the examples into 3D.
- Design a single creature (that you imagine living in a larger eco-system). Consider the design of the creature's physical form and how that animates in addition to its movement throughout the canvas itself.
- Investigate other interactions (beyond keyboard and mouse) and a physics environment (i.e. computer vision, machine learning, physical computing sensors, etc.)
- Use physics simulation to fabricate something -- a print, a sculpture, etc.
- Apply the concepts of motion to non-visual media, what does it mean for video playback or sound synthesis to respond to forces and emulate physical behaviors.
