# Autonomous Agents

## Core Material

For each module, I will provide written and video tutorials on the topics. You can review whichever format suits you best. If the amount feels overwhelming, please reach out and we can help you narrow things down, and select a subset of the material to focus an exercise around. It's a lot!

## Supplemental Material

For each module, I will provide a list of additional video tutorials and readings that you may draw on for further exploration. It's unlikely you would be able to consume everything in one week and if you are looking for guidance about what might fit with your interests and learning style the most, please reach out.

## Assignment

Incorporate a steering behavior into a p5.js sketch. Here are some ideas:

1. Expand / augment your simulation project incorporating the concept of a steering force: desired - velocity.
2. Create a path for agents to follow that is interactive or changes over time. What if the path has multiple segments? Can the points that define the path itself have their own steering behaviors? 
3. Add visual design elements for the environment and agents in the flocking system. Are they birds, fish, insects, fictional creatures? How does varying the behavior itself (weights of forces) add to the experience?
4. Try combining multiple steering behaviors into one agent. Can you create an interface (or set of rules) to control the weights of the various behaviors?
